namespace atomic_mutex
{
	/* Provides similar capability as std::shared_mutex but does so with "lock-free programming" atomic operations.
	Also provides an atomic shared-to-unique-lock upgrade capability, which std::shared_mutex does not provide.

	This can be used with std::shared_lock, std::unique_lock, etc. but is best used with the atomic_mutex::upgradable_lock.

	This mutex works by keeping track of the number of threads with a shared lock and the number of threads waiting for a unique lock
	(one of which may be uniquely locked). Unique locks have priority: all threads asking for a shared lock are blocked until the
	number of threads waiting for a unique lock is zero. All threads asking for a unique lock are blocked until the number of threads
	with a shared lock is zero, and also until there is no active unique lock (each thread asking for a unique lock proceeds one-at-
	a-time).

	To guarantee atomicity of all shared/unique thread counting, updating, and checking, all data is stored in one atomic integer using
	bit masking to count the number of threads *with* shared locks, the number of the threads *waiting* for a unique lock, and a flag
	indicating whether there is an active unique lock.

	The order of thread unblocking is not guaranteed. All threads just spin in loops until unblocked.

	Example usage:
		shared_atomic_mutex m;
		m.lock_shared();
		*read stuff from a cache on this line*
		if (*need to write to the cache*)
		{
			m.upgrade();
			*write stuff to cache*
			m.unlock();
		}
		else
		{
			m.unlock_shared();
		}

	Dos and don'ts:
	- Do call unlock_shared() when a shared lock is no longer necessary. You must explicitly unlock.
	- Do call unlock() when a unique lock is no longer necessary. You must explicitly unlock.
	- Do not acquire a unique lock before unlocking any shared lock in the same thread, unless upgrading.
	- Do not acquire a shared lock before unlocking any unique lock in the same thread.

	Helpful for understanding the flexibility of atomic operations:
